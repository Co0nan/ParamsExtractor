# ParamsExtractor
A burp-suite plugin that extract all parameters names from the in-scope requests.

You can run the plugin while you are working on the target application and it will log all the extracted parameters in the plugin tab.
Then you can export the result to a file and use that file with other parameter discovery tools.
